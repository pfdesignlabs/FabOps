Objective

Develop a reproducible hybrid PCB microfabrication process capable of producing functional prototypes using in-house laser and chemical methods.

Primary goals:
	1.	Copper ablation – remove all copper except desired traces on FR-1 copper-clad boards (chosen for its phenolic paper substrate and lower thermal conductivity vs FR-4).
	2.	Drilling – laser or mechanically drill vias and outline cuts.
	3.	Soldermask application – apply UV-curable soldermask after etching.
	4.	Pad clearing – selectively remove soldermask from pads using laser.
	5.	Silkscreen marking – laser-engrave component identifiers and text.

Phase 1 — Laser-Only Approach (xTool F1 Ultra)

Method

Copper-clad FR-1 panels were processed directly with the xTool F1 Ultra using LightBurn toolpaths generated from FlatCAM.
The intent was full copper ablation of the negative image (removing copper everywhere except traces).

Observations & Results
	•	Initial success – full copper removal achievable; sharp trace definition.
	•	Inconsistency – approximately 50 % of trials showed poor or no ablation effect despite identical parameters, suggesting focus or beam-stability issues.
	•	Thermal distortion – excessive localized heating caused substrate warping.
	•	Drilling limitation – insufficient optical power; multiple 100 % passes required. This led to pad delamination and carbonization of the FR-1 substrate.
	•	When drilling after trace clearing, remaining copper area could not dissipate heat, worsening pad burn-off.

Attempted Mitigation

Manual drilling performed using a resin-printed drill jig and Dremel drill press (1 mm bit).
	•	Precision acceptable for a few uses, but 3D-printed jig degraded rapidly.
	•	Process was slow (≈ 1 day per jig) and labor-intensive.

Conclusion (Phase 1)
Laser-only PCB fabrication on the xTool F1 Ultra is not reliable due to inconsistent beam output, limited drilling power, and heat-related damage.

Phase 2 — Transition to Laser-Etch Hybrid Process

New Approach

Switch to a chemical etching process where the laser defines the etch resist instead of removing all copper.

Steps
	1.	Surface preparation – clean FR-1 boards.
	2.	Coating – apply a uniform layer of Motip High Heat Paint as a laser-ablative resist.
	3.	Laser exposure – ablate the negative mask: remove paint where copper should remain (traces and pads).
	4.	Etching – immerse in sodium persulfate solution, ~30 min at elevated temperature with manual agitation.
	5.	Rinse and inspection – verify clean copper traces.

Results
	•	Produced high-fidelity copper patterns with good edge definition.
	•	Etch uniformity consistent across the panel.
	•	Laser performance still inconsistent on the xTool F1 Ultra (focus repeatability issues remain).

Phase 3 — Process Stabilization with Higher-Power Laser (ComMarker B6 MOPA 60 W)

Equipment Change

To overcome focus stability and power limitations, experiments transitioned to the ComMarker B6 60 W MOPA fiber laser.

Outcomes
	•	Drilling capability greatly improved; through-holes achieved in a few passes without overheating.
	•	Pad integrity maintained — heat dissipated efficiently through residual copper.
	•	Revised sequence adopted:
	1.	Drill holes first (B6 MOPA).
	2.	Spray resist and laser ablate trace pattern.
	3.	Etch with sodium persulfate.
	4.	Apply soldermask.
	5.	Laser-clear pads.
	6.	Laser-engrave silkscreen text.

Result
This hybrid process produced repeatable, high-quality prototypes suitable for small-batch production.

Next Steps
	1.	Parameter mapping & characterization
	•	Optimize B6 MOPA power, speed, and frequency for consistent resist ablation.
	•	Quantify etch rates versus temperature and agitation intensity.
	2.	Tooling refinement
	•	Modularize the work-holding jig for faster alignment.
	•	Improve drill-jig precision and durability.
	3.	Documentation
	•	Convert these validated steps into a formal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).
	4.	Integration
	•	Automate data capture (power, dwell time, etch duration) into FabOps telemetry stack for process monitoring.
