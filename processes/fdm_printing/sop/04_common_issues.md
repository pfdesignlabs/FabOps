# SOP — Common Issues
- **Poor first layer:** Re-run bed leveling; clean nozzle; add 0.05 mm live-Z offset for PETG.
- **Warping corners:** Increase bed temp +5 °C and add 5 mm brim; keep enclosure closed for ASA.
- **Ironing streaks:** Lower ironing speed to 15 mm/s and ensure top layer flow is ≥98%.
- **Stringing:** Dry filament and raise travel speed to 200 mm/s; increase retraction to 0.8 mm if needed.
