# SOP â€” Wash
1) Transfer build plate directly into HeyGears Wash to minimize drip.
2) Select `agitate` mode for 3 minutes, then `soak` for 2 minutes if parts have deep recesses.
3) Use fresh IPA for high-detail prints; swap bath when viscosity increases.
4) Blow off residual IPA with filtered air before curing.
