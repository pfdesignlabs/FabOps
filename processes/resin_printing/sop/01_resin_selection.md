# SOP â€” Resin Selection
1) Choose resin based on part use: PARP-10 for tough prototypes, PAU-10 for elastic features, PAP-10 for high-temp needs.
2) Verify expiration date and shake bottle for 2 minutes to re-suspend pigments.
3) Log resin batch ID in workflow validation sheet before pouring.
4) Match resin profile in HeyGears Cloud to avoid incorrect exposure times.
