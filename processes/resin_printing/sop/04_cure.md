# SOP â€” Cure
1) Remove supports that would shadow UV exposure; leave structural supports until after cure.
2) Place parts on turntable; set wavelength to 405 nm and duration to 8 minutes.
3) Rotate parts halfway through for complex geometries to ensure even exposure.
4) Inspect for tackiness; add 2-minute increments if surfaces remain soft.
