# Manufacturing Readiness Checklist

1. Validate that every critical component has an approved alternate in the BOM.
2. Ensure `process_fmea.md` is stored under `fabrication/assets/fmea/`.
3. Capture golden-sample data and reference it inside `playbooks/manufacturing_readiness.md`.
4. Confirm production test fixtures have matching maintenance procedures in `knowledge_base/`.
