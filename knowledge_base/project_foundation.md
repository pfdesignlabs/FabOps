# Foundation Kickoff Guidance

1. Validate the eight required FabOps inputs with stakeholders.
2. Decide which capabilities activate and record them in `fabops.config.json`.
3. Generate discipline folders using the bootstrap script and confirm steward assignments.
4. Store early risks in `decisions.md` for each active discipline.

Use this file during the onboarding workshop and keep it referenced in capability playbooks.
