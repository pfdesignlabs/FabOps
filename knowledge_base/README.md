# FabOps Knowledge Base

This library contains evergreen references, measurement guides, and examples that support capability playbooks and lifecycle gates. Each article is tagged with:

- `phase` – lifecycle phase(s) it supports
- `capabilities` – related capability handles from `01.capabilities/`
- `last_reviewed` – ISO date used for freshness tracking

Automation can parse the front-matter blocks to surface the right material during reviews.
