# EPIC — Electronics

## Purpose
Create a reliable electronics platform for Strom leveraging Atopile → ProtoEtch → KiCad workflows.

## Goals
- Breadboard validation of core sensing.
- Accelerated PCB iteration with ProtoEtch.
- Production-grade PCB for DVT/PVT.

## Scope
- ESP32 mainboard
- Hall + Coil current sensing
- I²C sensor stack
- Power stage design

## Out of Scope
- Firmware logic
- Manufacturing tooling

## KPIs
- PCB iteration time < 24h (ProtoEtch)
- First-pass boot success > 90%
- Stable sensor readout for 48h
