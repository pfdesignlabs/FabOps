# EPIC — Industrial Design (ID)

## Purpose
Develop a manufacturable, repeatable, Dieter-Rams–inspired geometry for Strom, enabling hybrid materials and scalable production.

## Goals
- Establish a stable parametric ID model.
- Validate ergonomics and physical interaction.
- Enable resin → concrete → PU transitions.
- Integrate DFM principles into early iterations.

## Scope
- Fusion 360 modeling
- Tolerances & assembly constraints
- Coil cavity + sensor zones
- Resin masters & fit testing

## Out of Scope
- Electronics integration details
- Firmware UX logic

## KPIs
- ID iteration cycle < 48h
- Fit validation passes without major rework
- Successful resin master within 2 prints
