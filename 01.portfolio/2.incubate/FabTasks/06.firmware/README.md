# 06.firmware — Embedded Software

Firmware for the FabTasks device:

- Architecture and module overview
- PlatformIO / build configuration
- Experiments and prototypes
- Integration with FabOps stack (MQTT, etc.)

Every firmware experiment that influences the final product
should be captured here, even if it started in a scratch repo.
