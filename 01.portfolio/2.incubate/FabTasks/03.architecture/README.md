# 03.architecture — System Architecture

This folder holds system-level architecture for FabTasks:

- Context diagrams (how FabTasks interacts with FabOps stack)
- Logical architecture (modules, data flows)
- Deployment / runtime view (where things run)

Keep architecture lean but explicit, so it can drive
implementation choices and risk management.
