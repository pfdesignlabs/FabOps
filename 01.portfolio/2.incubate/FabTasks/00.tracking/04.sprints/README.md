# 04.sprints — Time-Boxed Delivery

Sprints capture planning, execution, and retro in one place.

File naming convention:

- `sprint-01-YYYY-WWW.md` (use ISO week numbers if helpful)

Each sprint file should include:

- Goal (1–2 lines: what must be shippable)
- Scope (epics, stories, tasks in scope)
- Plan (focus, constraints, risks)
- Review (what got done, what slipped, why)
- Retro (start / stop / keep)

This structure mirrors the Strom project approach but is tailored
specifically for FabTasks.
