# 00.tracking — FabTasks Delivery Tracking

This folder is the **single source of truth** for all work tracking:

- **01.epics**: strategic capability streams that run across disciplines  
- **02.stories**: user stories linked to epics  
- **03.tasks**: executable work items linked to stories  
- **04.sprints**: time-boxed delivery windows (planning, review, retro)

The intent is to keep tracking **tool-agnostic** and text-first, so it
can be consumed by humans, scripts, and AI agents.
