# 02.stories — User Stories

User stories describe behaviour from a user perspective:
“As a \<user\> I want \<capability\> so that \<value\>.”

Conventions:

- One file per story: `FT-US-XXX-short-handle.md`
- Explicit link back to a single epic (`Epic: FT-EP-…`)
- Status: backlog / ready / in_progress / in_review / done
- Acceptance criteria as a checklist
- Evidence section with links to commits, PRs, screenshots, etc.

Stories are the bridge between epics (direction) and tasks (execution).
