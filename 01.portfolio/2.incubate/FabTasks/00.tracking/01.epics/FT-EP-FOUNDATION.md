# EPIC — FOUNDATION (FabTasks Governance & FabOps Alignment)

## Purpose
Establish a canonical, FabOps-compliant foundation for FabTasks.  
This epic develops the governance, structure, conventions, and evidence model needed for all PF Design Labs projects.

## Goals
- Provide a fully reproducible FabOps tracking structure.
- Define IDs, status models, evidence flows, and sprint mechanics.
- Align FabTasks with Strom and upstream FabOps capability framework.
- Create automation-friendly text-based tracking.

## Scope (In)
- Repo structure
- Tracking conventions
- Naming conventions
- Evidence model
- Sprint cycle definition
- Upstreaming to FabOps repo (later)

## Out of Scope
- Backend functionality
- Firmware/device logic
- UI tooling

## KPIs
- Structure reproducible across projects
- All items traceable (epic → story → task → evidence)
- STATUS.md reflects reality weekly

## Capability Level (C0 → C5)
Current: **C1**  
Next target: **C2 – First workflow in active use**
