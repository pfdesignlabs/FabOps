# EPIC — DEVICE (Hardware, PCB, Enclosure, Manufacturing)

## Purpose
Develop the FabTasks desk device: PCB, mechanical enclosure, manufacturing workflow, and electronics capability growth.

## Goals
- Create functional hardware prototype(s)
- Establish FR‑1 → Atopile → PVT workflow
- Build small-batch manufacturing repeatability

## Scope (In)
- PCB design & routing
- FR‑1 laser prototyping workflow
- Enclosure CAD
- Assembly & wiring
- BOM management

## Out of Scope
- Desktop UI
- Backend ingestion pipeline

## KPIs
- Fully working prototype
- Assembly < 30 min
- BOM cost stable and documented

## Capability Level
Current: **C1 (experiments + FR-1 boards)**  
Next: **C2 (first repeatable workflow)**
