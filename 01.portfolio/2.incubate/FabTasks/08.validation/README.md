# 08.validation — Test & Validation

Test and validation strategy for FabTasks:

- Functional tests
- Integration tests (device ↔ backend ↔ desktop tools)
- Long-term reliability tests (if relevant)
- Test protocols and checklists

Validation closes the loop: it connects requirements and architecture
to measurable outcomes in the real world.
