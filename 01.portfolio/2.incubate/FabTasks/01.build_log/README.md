# 01.build_log — Daily Work Logs

This folder is your chronological execution history.

Conventions:

- One file per focused work session or per day
- Naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_short-handle.md`
  - Example: `2025-11-23_bootstrap-structure.md`

Each log should cover:

- Context: what you intended to work on
- Worklog: bullet list of actions (checked when completed)
- Linked items: epics, stories, tasks
- Evidence: commit hashes, PRs, screenshots, photos, etc.

The build log is not a planning tool; it is **what actually happened**.
