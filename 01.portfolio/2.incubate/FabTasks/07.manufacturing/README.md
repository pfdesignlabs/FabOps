# 07.manufacturing — Manufacturing Process

This folder captures everything related to manufacturing:

- Process definitions (CNC, printing, casting, assembly)
- Jigs and fixtures
- Work instructions
- Quality checks

The goal is to move from “one-off prototype” to
repeatable, documented small-batch manufacturing.
