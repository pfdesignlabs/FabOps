# EPIC — Open-Source Packaging & Documentation

## Goal
Package FabTasks as an open repository that others can study,
fork, or adapt — without over-investing in polish at this stage.

## Objectives
- Clean public README with positioning and limitations.
- Minimal docs for replicating the stack (device + backend + UI).
- Clear boundaries between "internal hacks" and "reusable patterns".

## Scope
- Public-facing documentation.
- License and contribution notes.
- Examples of FabOps-aligned tracking.

## Out of Scope
- Building a SaaS offering.
- Supporting arbitrary external use cases.

## KPIs
- Repo is understandable for an external engineer in < 30 minutes.
- Core concepts (FabOps + FabTasks) clearly come across.
