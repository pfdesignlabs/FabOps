# EPIC — FabTasks Foundation & Governance

## Goal
Establish FabTasks as the internal, FabOps-aligned tracking product:
clear governance, repo structure, and conventions for epics, stories,
tasks, sprints, and evidence.

## Objectives
- FabTasks repo aligned with FabOps manifest and Strom tracking model.
- Text-first tracking that AI-agents and humans can both consume.
- Clear conventions for IDs, folder structure, and status reporting.

## Scope
- Defining FabTasks product vision and constraints.
- Setting up repo structure and baseline documentation.
- Defining tracking conventions (IDs, statuses, links to evidence).
- Aligning with FabOps v1.0 operational specification.

## Out of Scope
- Implementation of backend, device, or UI (these are separate epics).
- Commercialisation and external launch strategy.

## KPIs
- All FabTasks work items traceable via 00.tracking and 01.build_log.
- STATUS.md reflects real project status at least weekly.
- New projects can copy this structure with minimal changes.
