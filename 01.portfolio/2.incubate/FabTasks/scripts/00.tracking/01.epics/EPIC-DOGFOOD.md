# EPIC — Internal Dogfooding

## Goal
Use FabTasks on real PF Design Labs projects (zoals Strom, GFRC,
etc.) to validate that the concept actually helps focus and
documentation instead of adding friction.

## Objectives
- Track at least one full sprint of a real project with FabTasks.
- Use generated evidence (commits, logs) to update FabOps docs.
- Collect feedback on what works / what is annoying.

## Scope
- Setting up FabTasks for internal projects.
- Capturing feedback and converting it to new stories/tasks.
- Minimal reporting (what did we ship, waar ging tijd heen).

## Out of Scope
- External users of FabTasks.
- Public beta / SaaS.

## KPIs
- At least one project where >80% van het werk via FabTasks loopt.
- Concrete list of improvements for a v2.
