# EPIC — FabTasks Electronics

## Goal
Develop a small desk device PCB for FabTasks that can:
- connect over WiFi,
- talk MQTT to the backend, and
- drive the required UI hardware (e.g. screen, input).

This epic also captures the early FR-1 prototypes made with the
ComMarker laser.

## Objectives
- First working breadboard / FR-1 prototype (proof-of-concept).
- A revision suitable for small-batch manufacturing.
- Clear design rules aligned with in-house prototyping capability.

## Scope
- Schematic and PCB design for the FabTasks device.
- FR-1 laser-etched prototypes (ComMarker-based workflow).
- Component selection and BOM management.
- Basic power architecture and connectivity.

## Out of Scope
- Detailed enclosure design (covered in EPIC-ID if added later).
- High-volume DFM/DFT.

## KPIs
- At least one FR-1 prototype fully assembled and smoke-tested.
- Board can connect to WiFi and exchange MQTT messages.
- BOM cost reasonable for internal dogfooding units.
