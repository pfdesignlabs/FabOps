# US-OP-01 — As engineer, I want FabTasks to be understandable externally

**Epic:** EPIC-OPEN  
**Status:** backlog  
**Priority:** P3  

## Story

As an engineer looking at the FabTasks repo from the outside,
I want to understand what it does, how it ties into FabOps, and
what parts I can reuse, so that I can learn from or adapt it.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README explains FabTasks in < 1 page.
- [ ] High-level architecture available under 03.architecture.
- [ ] Clear indication of what is experimental vs. stable.
- [ ] Basic “getting started” path documented.

## Evidence

- README diff after writing external-facing copy: TODO
