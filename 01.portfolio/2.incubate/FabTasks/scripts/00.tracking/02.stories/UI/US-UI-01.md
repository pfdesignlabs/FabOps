# US-UI-01 — As user, I want a simple FabTasks desktop tool

**Epic:** EPIC-UI  
**Status:** backlog

## Story

As a user, I want a simple desktop tool that connects to the
FabTasks backend so that I can see my current task, start/stop
work, and optionally create new todos without context switching.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Desktop tool can connect to backend over the network.
- [ ] User can see current task and basic status.
- [ ] User can start/stop a task from the tool.
- [ ] New todos/tasks can be created and propagated to backend.
