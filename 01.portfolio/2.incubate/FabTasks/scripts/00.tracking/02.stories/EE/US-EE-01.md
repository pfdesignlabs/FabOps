# US-EE-01 — As engineer, I want a first FabTasks FR-1 prototype

**Epic:** EPIC-ELECTRONICS  
**Status:** in_progress  
**Priority:** P1  

## Story

As an engineer, I want a first FR-1 prototype PCB for the FabTasks
device (made with the ComMarker laser) so that we can validate
the basic layout, footprint choices, and our in-house PCB
prototyping flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least one FR-1 board is successfully etched and cut.
- [ ] Board is populated with components.
- [ ] Basic smoke test performed (no shorts, correct voltages).
- [ ] Notes captured in 01.build_log and 05.electronics.

## Notes

- “5 pcb gemaakt op fr1 met commarker laser” — captured from
  earlier discussions; this is part of this story.
- Exact design and schematic still need to be locked in.

## Evidence

- Photos of FR-1 boards: TODO
- commits: TODO
