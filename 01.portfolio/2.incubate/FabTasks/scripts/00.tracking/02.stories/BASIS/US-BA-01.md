# US-BA-01 — As PF, I want FabTasks aligned with FabOps

**Epic:** EPIC-BASIS  
**Status:** done  
**Priority:** P1  

## Story

As PF Design Labs, I want FabTasks to follow the FabOps manifest
and reuse the Strom tracking structure so that every new hardware
project can be tracked in a consistent way.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] FabTasks repo exists and is under version control.
- [x] Baseline folder structure created via bootstrap script.
- [x] 00.tracking contains epics, stories, tasks, sprints folders.
- [x] STATUS.md gives a high-level overview.
- [ ] FabTasks is referenced from broader FabOps documentation.

## Notes

- Initial structure bootstrapped with `bootstrap_fabtasks.py`.
- Based on lessons from Strom (00.tracking + build_log approach).

## Evidence

- commits: TODO (fill in after pushing to GitHub)
