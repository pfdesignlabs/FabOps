# US-DG-01 — As PF, I want to dogfood FabTasks on real projects

**Epic:** EPIC-DOGFOOD  
**Status:** backlog  
**Priority:** P2  

## Story

As PF Design Labs, I want to use FabTasks to track at least one
real project (e.g. Strom or GFRC lamps) end-to-end, so that we
can validate whether FabTasks genuinely improves focus and
documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] One project formally selected for FabTasks dogfooding.
- [ ] Epics/stories/tasks for that project are tracked in FabTasks.
- [ ] At least one sprint fully executed with FabTasks in the loop.
- [ ] Retro includes explicit feedback on FabTasks itself.

## Evidence

- build_log entries referencing FabTasks usage: TODO
