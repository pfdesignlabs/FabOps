## What is ProtoEtch?

ProtoEtch is a **desktop-scale PCB etching workstation** designed by PF Design Labs as part of the FabOps ecosystem.  
It automates and monitors the chemical etching process used to remove copper from PCB substrates (typically FR-1 or FR-4).  
The system combines **precision thermal control**, **fluid agitation**, and **real-time process logging** to produce highly repeatable prototype PCBs within hours.

At its core, ProtoEtch is powered by a **custom ESP32 controller** featuring a TFT interface, relay-driven heater control, and MOSFET-based pump actuation.  
It is supported by a **transparent chemical reservoir** with a submerged titanium heater and recirculation system, ensuring even etchant temperature and flow distribution.

By integrating sensors, control logic, and data telemetry (via MQTT ‚Üí InfluxDB ‚Üí Grafana), ProtoEtch transforms what was once a manual, error-prone step in PCB fabrication into a **quantified, data-driven process**.  
It serves as both a research tool and a scalable building block for other FabOps wet-process systems such as soldermask curing, electroplating, and chemical polishing.

**In short:** ProtoEtch bridges **chemical fabrication** and **digital manufacturing**, giving the FabOps architecture its first true ‚Äúsmart process node.‚Äù

## 1. Origin and Context  

ProtoEtch was conceived as the practical outcome of FabOps‚Äô PCB-prototyping research.  
Where the original experiments proved the *mask + etch* method reliable, the bottleneck shifted from pattern creation to **process control**‚Äîtemperature drift, agitation speed, and etchant aging all affected repeatability.  

To close that gap, a dedicated, network-connected etching station was designed to provide **repeatable, logged, and automated control** of the etching environment.  
ProtoEtch therefore represents the transition from *research validation* ‚Üí *process capability* within the FabOps electronics stream.

## 2. System Overview  

| Subsystem | Hardware | Function |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Controller PCB** | Custom ESP32-based board | Drives heater relay, pump MOSFET, reads DS18B20 bath sensor, manages TFT UI |
| **User interface** | 2.8" SPI TFT + rotary encoder + toggle switch | Start/stop cycle control and parameter adjustment |
| **Thermal control** | Schego Titanium heater (50‚Äì600 W) + relay output | Closed-loop temperature regulation |
| **Fluid circulation** | 24 V diaphragm pump + MOSFET driver + flyback diode | Maintains uniform etchant agitation |
| **Temperature sensing** | DS18B20 stainless probe (Teflon coated) | Real-time bath temperature feedback |
| **Ambient sensing** | Optional DHT22 | Logs room temp / humidity for process correlation |
| **Power** | 24 V DC input ‚Üí LM2596 buck ‚Üí 3.3 V logic rail | Common supply for heater relay, pump, controller |
| **Telemetry (FabOps)** | MQTT / InfluxDB / Grafana / Node-RED stack | Feeds live data to the FabOps monitoring layer |

## 3. Process Control Logic  

1. **Startup / Idle**  
   - System powers on, reads ambient and bath temperature.  
   - Display shows current temp + target + status.  

2. **Etch Cycle**  
   - User toggles the heater on; ESP32 drives relay until setpoint reached.  
   - Pump runs continuously once the heater engages by default. An alternate ‚Äúburst mode‚Äù delays pump start by 30 s when gentler agitation is required (configured via UI).  
   - Safety limits: heater cutoff > 60 ¬∞C, pump watchdog 30 s runtime.  

3. **Hold / Finish**  
   - Once etch temperature ‚âà 45 ¬∞C ¬± 0.8 ¬∞C is reached, system holds until manual stop.  
   - After stop, heater off, pump flushes for 30 s and halts.  
   - All events logged with timestamps.

## 5. Integration with FabOps  

ProtoEtch is the first FabOps-certified **‚Äúprocess-tool‚Äù node**, publishing live telemetry via MQTT.  
It exposes:  

| Topic | Data | Frequency |
|--------|------|-----------|
| `fabops/protoetch/temp/bath` | ¬∞C from DS18B20 | 2 s |
| `fabops/protoetch/temp/ambient` | ¬∞C from DHT22 | 5 s |
| `fabops/protoetch/humidity` | %RH | 5 s |
| `fabops/protoetch/heater/state` | on/off | event-driven |
| `fabops/protoetch/pump/state` | on/off | event-driven |

InfluxDB stores these values for trend analysis; Grafana dashboards visualize temperature profiles and warm-up efficiency.  
This turns a once-manual chemical process into a **quantified manufacturing operation** consistent with the broader FabOps telemetry framework.

## 7. Outlook  

ProtoEtch moves FabOps from ‚Äúcapability experiments‚Äù into **closed-loop digital process control**.  
The system bridges mechanical, chemical, and digital fabrication domains‚Äîlaser, heater, and data stack‚Äîinto one autonomous node.  

Next steps:
- Finalize firmware (PID heater control + MQTT telemetry).  
- Integrate ambient-sensor data into analytics.  
- Produce enclosure v2 with transparent reservoir, quick-disconnect pump fittings, and removable PCB carrier.  

When complete, ProtoEtch will serve as the **reference architecture** for all FabOps wet-process stations (soldermask curing, electroplating, chemical polishing, etc.).
