# Hardware Capability

Owns mechanical systems, assemblies, and integration across subsystems.

## Deliverables
- System architecture breakdowns and tolerance analyses
- Assembly drawings and exploded views
- Mechanical BOM linked to procurement
- Test fixtures + validation rigs

## KPIs
- Assembly readiness (percentage of parts with SOP)
- Validation throughput (builds/week)
- Blocker resolution rate prior to gate reviews

## Operating Rhythm
1. Map architecture in `02.knowledge_base/03.system_architecture/` before detailed CAD.
2. Coordinate with CAD Design for manufacturable geometries.
3. Document assembly validation and feed learnings into `08.mass_production` knowledge articles.

## Interfaces
- Provides requirements to CAD Design and Manufacturing.
- Receives telemetry/constraints from Electronics and Software.

Use the capability metadata to keep automation aware of dependencies and deliverables.
