# 3D Printing — FDM

Use this flow for quick-turn mechanical proofs and jigs.

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `01.research/` | Material datasheets, slicer profiles, tolerance tests |
| `02.process_development/` | Iterations on infill, wall thickness, strength experiments |
| `03.validation/` | Dimensional reports, microscopy photos, fit checks |
| `04.standardization/` | Reusable settings, calibration routines |
| `05.examples/` | Canonical print projects with BOM + CAD |
| `06.standard_operating_procedure/` | Controlled SOP with machine + material requirements |
| `07.scripts/` | G-code snippets, slicing macros, automation |

Link measurement evidence in `knowledge_base/manufacturing_readiness.md` when the process feeds EVT/DVT builds.
