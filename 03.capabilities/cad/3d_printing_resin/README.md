# 3D Printing — Resin

Track resin-specific experiments, especially for high-detail masters.

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `01.research/` | Resin exposure matrices, post-cure studies |
| `02.process_development/` | Support strategy tests, distortion tracking |
| `03.validation/` | Surface finish, dimensional inspection, CMF trials |
| `04.standardization/` | Printer prep checklists, resin handling SOP fragments |
| `05.examples/` | Reference masters for ID validation |
| `06.standard_operating_procedure/` | Signed SOP + hazard controls |
| `07.scripts/` | ChituBox presets, post-processing timers |

Tie each validated recipe back to the CAD readiness score so manufacturing can select the right master workflow.
