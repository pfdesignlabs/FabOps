# Vacuum Casting

Use this pathway when transitioning from masters to silicone tooling.

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `01.research/` | Resin systems, durometer options, mold design notes |
| `02.process_development/` | Trials on venting, degassing, cure cycles |
| `03.validation/` | Yield metrics, defect photos, tolerance stacks |
| `04.standardization/` | Control plans, QC gates for each pour |
| `05.examples/` | Documented builds with full traveler history |
| `06.standard_operating_procedure/` | Locked SOP + tooling maintenance |
| `07.scripts/` | Spreadsheet/Python helpers for mix ratios and cure timers |

Sync key learnings with `knowledge_base/manufacturing_readiness.md` before EVT/DVT gates.
