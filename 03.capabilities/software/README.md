# Software Capability

Delivers telemetry, dashboards, and connected experiences that complement FabOps hardware programs.

## Deliverables
- Architecture for backend, integrations, and dashboards
- Instrumentation plan (metrics, logging, OTA hooks)
- Launch-ready UX flows + automated monitoring

## KPIs
- Time to deploy validated experiment
- % coverage of telemetry requirements per launch
- Uptime / MTTR for deployed services

## Operating Rhythm
1. Partner with Discovery + Strategic Fit to capture user journeys.
2. Document integration contracts, API schemas, and data flows.
3. Prepare launch orchestration artifacts referenced in `02.knowledge_base/09.launch/README.md`.
4. Maintain runbooks and monitoring references for Post-Launch.

## Interfaces
- Consumes requirements from electronics and hardware (sensors, devices).
- Feeds GTM teams with dashboards and content.
