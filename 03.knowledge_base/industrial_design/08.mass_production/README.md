# Mass Production Guide

## Objectives
- Ramp manufacturing with stable yield, cost, and logistics.
- Maintain ECO/ECR discipline and feedback loops with the field.

## Required Deliverables
- Yield dashboard and SPC metrics.
- ECO/ECR log with disposition decisions.
- Supplier scorecards + contract status.

## Evidence Checklist
- Manufacturing readiness score exported from CAD Design capability.
- Link to finance forecasts referencing production volumes.
- Service/repair plan for the first production batches.

## Capability Hooks
- **Hardware:** drives ECO/ECR and ensures mechanical updates propagate.
- **CAD Design:** maintains tooling documentation and process change logs.
