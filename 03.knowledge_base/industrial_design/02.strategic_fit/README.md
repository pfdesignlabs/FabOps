# Strategic Fit Guide

## Objectives
- Align the initiative with PF Design Labs' portfolio, revenue targets, and capability roadmap.
- Decide resourcing, rescope, or defer.

## Required Deliverables
- Strategic fit matrix (value vs effort, synergy with existing IP).
- Capability loading plan (who leads hardware/software/CAD threads).
- Decision memo that documents Go / Hold / Kill rationale.

## Evidence Checklist
- Financial or strategic metrics (TAM/SAM, gross margin target, capability reuse).
- Stakeholder sign-off recorded in `decisions.md`.

## Capability Hooks
- **Hardware:** confirm feasibility and identify required suppliers or labs.
- **Software:** determine integrations, data platforms, and licensing needs.
- **CAD Design:** align on design language + manufacturing pathways to pursue.
