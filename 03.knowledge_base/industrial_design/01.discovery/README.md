# Discovery Phase Guide

## Objectives
- Validate the problem space with real users and quantify opportunity size.
- Capture constraints and early risks for downstream capabilities.
- Decide whether the project deserves Foundation resources.

## Inputs
- Product brief or idea backlog entry.
- Access to potential users or internal subject-matter experts.

## Required Deliverables
- JTBD interview summaries or observation notes.
- Opportunity map with impact vs feasibility.
- Draft success criteria and guardrails.

## Evidence Checklist
- At least three external conversations documented with transcript links.
- Market size calculation and early competitor scan.
- Risk list with owner + mitigation idea.

## Capability Hooks
- **Hardware:** capture physical constraints that inform `03.system_architecture`.
- **Software:** document integration requirements, data sources, or UX assumptions.
- **CAD Design:** note CMF/experience references that will influence geometry exploration later.

## Related Knowledge
- Reference `knowledge_base/project_foundation.md` for the canonical kickoff checklist.
