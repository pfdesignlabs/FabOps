# Operator UI Concept (Preview)

We will render workflows into **operator-friendly cards**:
- Clear steps (manual vs automated)
- Timers, thermometers, checkboxes
- Photo uploads and metrics logging

Example card set for ProtoEtch:
1) Preheat bath to 42 Â°C (live temp gauge)  
2) Insert PCB & agitate for 10 min (timer)  
3) Rinse & dry (confirm)  
4) Inspect under light (photo upload)
