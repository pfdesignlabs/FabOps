# FabOps Documentation Index

FabOps captures **repeatable fabrication knowledge**: machines, materials, and workflows.  
This is the “playbook” we reuse across projects (e.g., SnapSync).

- Start with `/machines/` to understand available equipment.
- Use `/processes/` to reproduce workflows.
- See `/docs/methodology.md` for validation practices.

This doc set is written to be **operator-friendly** and **engineer-precise**.
